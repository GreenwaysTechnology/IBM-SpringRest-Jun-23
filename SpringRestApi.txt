What is Spring Framework?

  Spring is Java Framework to build enterprise distributed application.

Types of application?
=>Desktop application
=>Network based application
   Apps runs in the remote machine and accessed that apps via network.
 =>Client Server Arch
	Application has three major layer(tier)
    ->Data Layer -Where we store data
    ->Biz layer - Where we process data
    ->Presentation Layer - Where we present  data

 ->Mainframe based arch
 ->Layered Client server arch without mainframeworks
    ->Single/One tier client server - >Both storage and biz processing kept in single 				      machine,where as ui layer is kept separately.

   ->Two/tier client server
        Database/Storage layer is separated, biz processing layer is kept in one 	machine, and ui also kept in the same machine.

   ->Three tier client server 
	Data layer , Biz processing layer, Ui layer is kept in different machines

   ->N-tier client server 
      Data Layer
      Biz processing layer
	->MOM Layer - Message oriented middlware -
        ->Rpc layer - Remote Procedure call-app to app interaction.
        ->Integration layer - ESB (Enterprise Server Bus)
    Each layer can be kept in different and different machines , each layer can communicate over network using its own networking protocals

What is Distributed Application?
    Distributed application is other wise called "N-tier client server arch"
 Software components runs in different and different machines and talks over networking using "its own protocal"..

How to build distributed apps?
   You can build distributed applications in any technology like "java",".netnet",php,python,node.js,.....

Distributed application types:
..............................
Now a days distributed apps are built using various patterns.

1.Monolithic Architecture pattern
    Legacy way of building "distributed apps"
2.Microservice Architecture pattern
    Modern way of building "distributed apps"


		 Since Spring is Distribtued java App framework
		  We can build "Mononlolithic" and also we can 
		    build "Microservices" based apps.


As a java developer, I need to know what are the concepts available to start 
building Monololithic apps in Spring.

1.Spring core Framework & Boot
2.Spring Data 
3.Api Development using webservices - Rest / Soap
4.Integration /MOM using Rabbitmq or Kafka....

			 History Of Spring Framework
....................................................................................

Early 2000,Java become very popular for building distributed Applications.

Java Technology Types:

1.JSE 
   -Core java programming language
2.JEE
  -Building distributed apps 
3.JME
  -Device apps like mobile

JCP - Java Community Process
 Who standarize the entire Java Technology.

Java works based on Specification,
   Rules and regualations how things are working.

JSE - How java programming language works
JVM - How Java vm can be implementated.

Browser             Servlet/JSP      EJB               Entity Beans

EJB :Enterprise Java Bean
  Java Object can support distributed biz operations
eg: incase of shopping cart
  I have a bean(java object) which has three apis addToCart,Checkout,Payment)

Api classifications:
1.Session Bean  - to represent biz logic---jdbc--dml
2.Enitity bean  -ORM - Object to Table mapping-First orm solution---Hibernate
3.Message Driven Bean - Message driven systems-RabbitMQ,Kaffka,JMS

Rod johnson  was working in enterprise banking application with jee, he faced lot of 
complexity in designing ejb driven systems, so he decided to move out ejb from JEE application, he wrote book called expert  J2EE ONE ON ONE design and development.


He proposed a model  that model later on came as The project in "Spring Season" - Spring Framework.

Client Layer         Web Layer      Biz layer                Data Layer/Persistency

Browser             Spring MVC     Spring Services              Spring-orm - Spring-data

Spring development objective is "POJO". (Plain Old Java Object)

When you build enterprise java apps, no plumbing(bolier plate code),Spring framework takes care that plumbing.


Java is Object Oriented Programming language.

Apps built on java collection of objects.

Object Oriented Principles:
...........................

1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.Hierarchy
4.Typing
5.Modularity
----------------------
6.Concurrency
7.Persistency

1.Object Management :Hierarchy

Object Relationship

-HAS-A -  Composition
-IS-A - Inheritance.

Enterprise application challanges:

1.Object Management

IOC : Inversion of Control
 Inversion -Do opposit
 of Control -Management

In enterprise application object creation and linking objects are so complex that should be removed from the developer.

Someone should take care object creation and linking= 
  =>This process is called as IOC.
The IOC suggest the automation program,that program called as IOC Container.


class Order {
   Product product
}

class Customer{
   Order order
}

class Product {
  Item item
}
class Item {

}

Customer information
 ->Order
     -Product
        -Item

You have to create Object Object for every class
You have to pass object reference to every Object - HAS-A

 new Customer(new Order(new Item()))
	IOC

 Invert- Do opposit 
 ofControl -Management

 Do opposit Management 

Management - creating object and mainitain its relationship references
		-developer via code

Do Opposit - Dont create create object , dont management object life cycle
   IOC
Some body has to create objects and manage its relationship - "Automated Program"
   -IOC Container

ioc container implementation:
 -Spring framework provides at core ioc container - Spring Context
.....................................................................................
			Spring Application
.....................................................................................
   The application is written in java technology, executed on Spring Container which is runtime for spring applications.spring container runs on jvm

Make Java enterprise distribute application easy way.

=>IOC and Dependency Injection
     -How to create objects and how to link objects.

Spring Provides

1.Application code
   classes which expose biz logic and apis

2.Infrastructure code
  creating objects
  initalization dependencies

Spring takes care of infra code, where develper takes care of app code.

....................................................................................
				Spring Core Concepts
....................................................................................

Spring Core Concepts:

1.Spring Bean

What is Bean?
   
  Bean is terminallogy coined by SUN Micro System to name java object.

Object vs Bean?

 -Same but Bean has some special characteristics  which was proposed by SUN micro system via 
"Java Bean Spec"

It is java class, based Java Bean standards
 	-class should be public
 	-properties should be private
 	-set and get methods - Accessors and mutators
	-constructors

Why Bean Spec?
  - in order to standarize the java dev process- Coding Standards.

public class Customer {
  private  int id;
  private String name;
}
    "Spring  follows java bean spec in order to create object and links objects"

class CustomerService {

   private CustomerRespository rep;

   CustomerService(){

   }
   set /get

}
class CustomerRespository{


}

Spring Bean is Java Object follows Bean Specification and also managed by Spring Container.

.....................................................................................			  	 Spring Bean Creation(Object)
.....................................................................................


Who creates Spring Beans?

 -Spring Container

 Spring container is java object, which manages object(bean) life cycle like   create,use,destroy.

How spring beans are created?

-> you must have bean definitions outside application biz logic
-> sp container reads that bean definitions, initalizes the beans.

Architecture:

			POJO Classes(Bean)
				 |
    Spring-Application <====>SpringContainer
      config file		 |
		       Fullyconfigured System


Spring Bean Definitions(file) instructs Spring Container how to create objects(order of creations) and how to link (DI) objects

....................................................................................
			Spring Application Configuration Management
.....................................................................................

Spring Application can be configured in many ways

1.XML files  -  Old and Legacy.

2.Java Config + Annotations

2.1 Java Config -Manual - Write Configuration and logic

 Here Dev need to write Configuration and biz logic , which makes app dev slower.

Just Focus logic, automate configuration itself - AutoConfig

3.AutoConfig:
    Framework must take care of configuration based on various conditions like
 i want web and jpa , messaging.
                        "Birth of Spring Boot"

....................................................................................
				Spring Project Setup 
	    

What are the required components to setup Spring Project.

1.IDE,mvn,java

2.Project layout


Spring Project requires

Infra Structure:
 1.Project libraries

 2.Project Configurations

Application Structure

1.Application code
2.assets - imgs,docs
3.App Configuration

mvn or gradel

.............................................................................................
				    Spring Project Creations
............................................................................................

Whether you build app using Boot or Old Spring Framework Two things you have to take care

1.Project Dependency -  Libraries- core,web,data,cloud,logger....
  You have to manage
  Spring have to manage - Boot via starters

2.Application Configuration
   -Bean defintions -  xml
   

Spring Project Using Spring Framework method:

Steps:

1.create Plain Maven Project

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>org.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>myspringframework</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-core -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
            <version>6.0.10</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>


2.place beans.xml in the class path - resources/beans.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- bean definitions here -->

</beans>

3.Configure the Bean in beans.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- bean definitions here -->
        <bean id="hello" class="com.ibm.spring.app.HelloWorld" />
</beans>

4.Load Bean Definitions and Access the Bean
package com.ibm.spring.app;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class BeanCreationWithSpring {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      //Load Spring Container:XMLContainer,JavaConfigContainer,BootContainer
        ApplicationContext context =new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
        HelloWorld helloWorld = context.getBean(HelloWorld.class);
        System.out.println(helloWorld.sayHello());
    }
}
.............................................................................................
				 Dependency Injection
............................................................................................

What is dependency Injection?

  Linking objects
  Setting Object Property values

  Setting Object references with Object who refers it.

Dependency Injection on reference types and Primitives

eg:
  OrderService needs OrderRepository


Types of DI:

1.Setter
    Linking objects after objects created
2.Constructor
    Linking objects, During object creation.

When to use Setter vs Constructor?

Note: 
 Constructor properties are initlized during object creations
 Settter properties are initlized after object creations

Spring supports both.You can mix and match.

Constructors:
  ->Enforce mandatory dependencies

Setters:
 1.Allow optional dependenices

DI Values:
 You can inject primtives / scaller such as int,sting,char,boolean
 You can inject Objects(reference types) - Customer,Order,Address,Repository
 You can inject Collection types - such as List,Map,Set...

Proerty can have child elements:List
<property name="shippingAddress">
	<list>
		<ref bean="address" />
		<ref bean="address" />
		<ref bean="address" />
		<ref bean="address" />
		<ref bean="address" />

1.Via class  
   Spring creates using new Operator
  new Order()

2.Via Factory Pattern

-if constructor marked private
   via factory factory api


beans.xml
        <bean id="authService" class="com.ibm.spring.app.di.factory.AuthService"  factory-method="getInstance"/>

AuthService.java
package com.ibm.spring.app.di.factory;

public class AuthService {
    private String userName = "admin";
    private String password = "admin";

    private AuthService() {
    }
    // Factory Api
    public static AuthService getInstance() {
        return new AuthService();
    }

    public String getUserName() {
        return userName;
    }

    public void setUserName(String userName) {

    }

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.password = password;

					Bean Scopes
.............................................................................................
Generally, you can create multiple instance from bean definition.
  some times if you want to control that bean creation
you can use bean creation scope.

Spring supports 6 scopes:

1.singleton
 (Default) Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance for each Spring IoC container.
 if you call getBean no of time, spring returns the only one instance at any point of time.
This is default scope.

.
2.prototype:
a new bean instance is created every time a request for that specific bean is made 
that is, the bean is injected into another bean or you request it through a getBean() method call on the container.

autowire:

Dependency Injections:
 ->property - setter injections
 ->constructor-arg ref ->constructor injections

 
->autowire 
Which is not new injection type, but it simplifies property and constructor injections

     no ->Explicit via property or constructor-arg
     byName - Implicit via property
     byType - Implicit via type + property
     constructor - Implicit via constructor

}
Bean life cycles:
.................
init
destroy

Points:
1.if you want to initalize the resources,
 Resources:
   Resource is nothing but ,something outside jvm
    ex: FileSystem,Databases,Network sockets,Graphics context....
  Resources must be mananaged properly , if not , it will give you
 memory leaks.

In general , resources are initialized inside Class constructors
eg:Establishing database,socket connections, create file points,open file

According to spring best practices, dont do it inside constructor
 Why
   WHich hindrences the bean intialization, which will drop app startup performance.

then where can i initlaize
 spring provides life cycle hooks

   ->init-method="initmethod"
   ->destroy-method="destroymethod" - Resouce clean up

    <bean id="customerLifeCycle" class="com.ibm.spring.app.beanlifecycle.CustomerService" init-method="init" destroy-method="destroy" />


package com.ibm.spring.app.beanlifecycle;

public class CustomerService {

    public void init(){
        System.out.println("Init");
    }
    public  void destroy(){
        System.out.println("Destroy");
    }
}

public class LifeCycleMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext factory = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
        factory.getBean(CustomerService.class);

    }
}

//        ApplicationContext factory = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");

        factory.getBean(CustomerService.class);
        factory.registerShutdownHook();

    }
}

				 Container Extensions Points

Typically, an application developer does not need to subclass  ApplicationContext implementation classes.

 Instead, the Spring IoC container can be extended by plugging in implementations of special integration interfaces.

BeanPostProcessor: Extensions
..................
  BeanPostProcessor are classes that tells Spring what should be done after beans are created.

    <bean class="com.ibm.spring.app.extensions.BeanPostProcessorExtension"/>

package com.ibm.spring.app.extensions;

import org.springframework.beans.BeansException;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor;

public class BeanPostProcessorExtension implements BeanPostProcessor {

    //This method will be called after bean creation
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
        System.out.println("postProcessAfterInitialization : " + bean + " " + beanName);
        return bean;
    }

    //this method will be called before before bean creation.
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
        System.out.println("postProcessBeforeInitialization : " + bean + " " + beanName);
        return bean;
    }
}

2.BeanFactoryPostProcessor : Container Extension, where we instrument container itself.

<bean class="com.ibm.spring.app.extensions.FactoryBeanPostProcessorExtension"/>
package com.ibm.spring.app.extensions;

import org.springframework.beans.BeansException;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableListableBeanFactory;

public class FactoryBeanPostProcessorExtension implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor {

    public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException {

        System.out.println("Container Extensions : " + beanFactory);

    }

	Spring provides lot of built in Extensions


PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer :
   It is used to externalize the bean property values
eg:

Bean defintion file
<bean id="customer" class="com.ae.spring.entity.Customer"
  <property name="customerId" value="100">
</bean>

With PropertyPlaceHolder = ${propertykey} => propValue
eg: 
<bean id="customer" class="com.ae.spring.entity.Customer"
  <property name="customerId" value="${customer.id}">
</bean>

PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer 

classpath:customer-info.properties
customer.id=1
customer.name=Ram

eg:
Steps:
1.property file
src/main/java/customer-info.properties
customer.id=1
customer.name=Ram
2.Activate Extension to read Property file
  ->
<beanclass="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
		<property name="locations" value="classpath:customer-info.properties" />
</bean>

3.Read Property value:
		ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
		Customer customer = context.getBean("customer", Customer.class);
		System.out.println(customer.getId() + " " + customer.getName());
